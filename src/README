This folder contains all code.

Subfolders should be sorted by language or framework, primarily, if there's
more than one.

For example,

  src/
    flex/
    rails/

(Which is pretty common in our projects.)

Obviously this is unnecessary if the project is all in one language, but how
often is life that simple?
